These github pages are based on the excellent
[al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), a simple and clean
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for academics.

I have made some modifications to al-folio in order to make the look and feel
closer to my personal liking. Unlike the instructions and perhaps common
practice, I feel very uncomfortable in having the sources and the web pages in
two different branches of the same repo. For that reason:

* This repo here hosts the deployment files
* The sources are hosted under
  [g-oikonomou/al-folio](https://github.com/g-oikonomou/al-folio). Same as with
  the original al-folio, they are distributed under the terms of the MIT
  license.
